**MotionDesk** is a cutting-edge application that revolutionizes the way users interact with their desktop environments through *gesture control*. By utilizing advanced technologies such as [**OpenCV**](https://github.com/opencv/opencv) and [**MediaPipe**](https://github.com/google/mediapipe), MotionDesk enables a completely hands-free workflow, allowing users to navigate their systems using intuitive hand gestures.

## Key Features

- **Gesture-Controlled Interface**: MotionDesk employs sophisticated gesture recognition to control mouse movements and keyboard inputs without the need for physical devices. This allows for a seamless and efficient user experience.

- **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built with [**CustomTkinter**](https://github.com/TomSchimansky/CustomTkinter), the application features a user-friendly GUI that simplifies the configuration and customization of gesture controls, making it accessible for users of all technical levels.

- **Real-Time Processing**: Utilizing OpenCV's robust computer vision capabilities, MotionDesk processes motion data in real-time, ensuring that gestures are recognized and executed instantly.

- **MediaPipe Integration**: By leveraging MediaPipe's powerful hand tracking and gesture recognition models, MotionDesk accurately detects user movements and translates them into actionable commands on the desktop.
